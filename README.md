# BeyondCorp Enterprise Client Connector Terraform Module

Googleâ€™s BeyondCorp Enterprise (BCE) Client Connector allows customers to secure
non-http workloads resident in non-GCP environments. A common use case is to
secure legacy client-server applications with context-aware checks.

This document provides a step-by-step walk-through of deploying the gateway
component responsible for tunneling the user traffic to the applications. The
gateway comprises the following high-level resources:

-   Regional Managed Instance Groups (MIGs): deployed per-region as configured
    by the customer.

-   OpenVPN server: runs on instances. Responsible for authorizing client
    connections and forwarding traffic to destination remote subnets.

-   External Global TCP Proxy Load Balancer: exposes a global static IP address
    for clients to connect to and balances traffic across backend MIGs.

The solution uses Terraform to actuate the above resources.

## Prerequisites

-   Terraform version >= 0.13

-   OpenSSL

-   Cloud VPN connection between a GCP project and the remote environment
    (onprem or another cloud).

    If you don't have one configured, then do the following:

    1.  [Create a new project and set up billing](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

        ```
        gcloud projects create [PROJECT_ID]
        gcloud beta billing projects link [PROJECT_ID] --billing-account=[ACCOUNT_ID]
        ```

    1.  [Configure Cloud VPN](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-ha-vpn)
        in a custom VPC network.

## Deployment Steps

The "project" and "vpc_network" referred in the steps below are the GCP project
and the custom VPC network, respectively, configured with the Cloud VPN
connection. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1.  Enable the following APIs in the project:

    -   [Compute Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/compute.googleapis.com)
    -   [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
    -   [IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com)

    ```
    gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com
    ```

1.  [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-gcloud).
    This is the account that will be used to authenticate with GCP when running
    the terraform script.

1.  Assign Compute Admin IAM role to the service account.

    ```
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/compute.admin"
    ```

1.  Share the service account with Google for permission provisioning (for
    storage in producer project), according to the process described in the user
    guide.

1.  Generate the Diffie-Hellman key used to configure the server.

    ```
    openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048
    ```

1.  Run terraform to actuate resources. FILEPATH is the `.tfvars` file
    containing the [input variables](#key-inputs).

    ```
    terraform apply -var-file=[FILEPATH]
    ```
